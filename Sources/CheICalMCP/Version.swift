               \(name) --cli <tool> [--key value ...]
               echo '{"tool":"...","arguments":{}}' | \(name) --cli

        Options:
          --version, -v    Show version information
          --help, -h       Show this help message
          --setup          Request Calendar & Reminders permissions and exit.
                           Run this once from Terminal before using with launchd
                           or other non-interactive environments.
          --print-tcc-path Print binary's runtime path, bundle ID, current TCC
                           authorization status, execution context (parent process
                           chain — the status is context-dependent), and ready-to-

                           .mcpb-installed users who need to locate the extracted
                           binary for --setup.
          --self-update    Check GitHub Releases for a newer binary, download
                           and install it at the current binary's path. Use
                           when an existing install needs to upgrade — wrapper
                           auto-download covers fresh-install only (#49).
          --cli <tool>     Run a tool directly without MCP server.
                           Pass arguments as --key value pairs, or pipe JSON via stdin.
