/// operations where Apple-produced `localizedDescription` strings could (now or
/// in a future macOS) interpolate user-controlled reminder/event content.
///
/// The sanitizer reads only `NSError.domain` and `NSError.code` — never
/// `userInfo`, `localizedDescription`, or any other field that could carry
/// human-readable text. The full `localizedDescription` is returned alongside
/// the sanitized code as `rawLog` so the caller can write it to stderr (or
/// another trusted channel) without forwarding it to the client.
///
/// Callers MUST forward `rawLog` to a trusted channel (typically stderr) when
/// they would otherwise have used `error.localizedDescription` for debugging
/// — dropping `rawLog` silently degrades operator visibility. Conversely, the
/// `code` is the only field safe to embed in client-visible responses.

/// Marker protocol that opts a Swift `Error` type into pass-through dispatch
/// by `EventKitErrorSanitizer.sanitizeForResponse(_:)` — the type's author
/// asserts that `errorDescription` (or `localizedDescription`) is hand-written
/// and safe to forward verbatim to MCP clients without sanitization.
///
/// Opt in only when the description is fully author-controlled. Do NOT make
/// Foundation types like `URLError` / `CocoaError` / `POSIXError` conform —
/// their messages come from Apple frameworks and may carry user-content.
/// Checking `is LocalizedError` would be too broad; this empty protocol is
/// the explicit opt-in used by `eventkit-error-sanitization` spec R5.
///
/// **Canonical conformer list** (CheICalMCP module):
///   - `ToolError` (Server.swift)
///   - `EventKitError` (EventKit/EventKitManager.swift)
///   - `CLIRunner.CLIError` (CLIRunner.swift)
///   - `UnrecoverableUndoError` (EventKit/UndoManager.swift)

/// Adding a new conformer MUST update both this list AND the test
