# Reminder recurrence and completion results (#194)

`list_reminders` and `search_reminders` now return these additive fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `has_recurrence` | Whether the observed reminder currently carries recurrence rules. This does not promise another occurrence exists. |
| `recurrence_rules` | All public EventKit rules; `[]` for non-recurring items, `null` when a recurring item's rules are unavailable or empty (never `[]` next to `has_recurrence: true`). |
| `due` | `date`, `time`, `timezone`, `calendar_identifier`, `date_time`; null when no complete calendar date is available. `due.date` is the reminder's own calendar date; legacy `due_date` is the UTC instant and can name a different day. |

Rule objects include `frequency`, `interval`, `calendar_identifier`, `first_day_of_week`, `days_of_week`, `days_of_week_details` (objects with `day` and `week_number`), `days_of_month`, `months_of_year`, `weeks_of_year`, `days_of_year`, `set_positions`, `end_date`, and `occurrence_count`. Unspecified selectors are null. `frequency_raw_value` (EventKit's raw enum value) is always included, so a future frequency that serializes as `"unknown"` stays distinguishable. Weekdays use 1=Sunday through 7=Saturday; a negative ordinal is preserved. `occurrence_count` is the rule's limit, not remaining occurrences. This read format is richer than the existing recurrence input format; it is not a promise of lossless write-back.

`due.time` is `HH:MM:SS` — a missing minute or second is rendered as `00`, as EventKit treats it; sub-second precision, when the components carry it, is rendered as milliseconds on both `time` and `date_time`. `due.date_time` is an ISO 8601 UTC instant only for a valid, unambiguous date with explicit time and timezone. Date-only reminders retain the date and null time/instant. Floating reminders retain wall-clock values with null timezone/instant. DST gaps and folds do not invent an instant. Legacy `due_date`, `_local`, count, sorting and filtering behavior remain unchanged.

## Completing and reopening

Read `operation.status`, not legacy `is_completed`, to determine whether the write succeeded. EventKit may advance a repeating item to an incomplete occurrence after saving completion. The write and the observed state are different facts.

```json
{
  "action": "completed",
  "id": "reminder-123",
  "title": "Read",
  "is_completed": false,
  "has_recurrence": true,
  "operation": {
    "type": "complete",
    "status": "succeeded",
    "requested_completed": true,
    "target": {"id": "reminder-123", "due": null, "was_completed": false}
  },
  "next_occurrence": {
    "status": "unknown",
    "reason": "due_not_comparable",
    "reminder": null
  },
  "message": "This occurrence was completed successfully. The next occurrence could not be confirmed."
}
```

The example is illustrative. `has_recurrence` and `operation.target` capture the item **before** mutation. `is_completed` and `title` retain the saved object's values. `completed=false` produces `operation.type="reopen"` and `next_occurrence.status="not_applicable"`; legacy `action="completed"` is intentionally preserved for existing clients. A non-boolean `completed` (string or number) is rejected before any read or write on all three reminder tools (BREAKING, see CHANGELOG). Omitted or JSON `null` keeps each tool's meaning: on `complete_reminder` it means complete; on the `completed` filter of `list_reminders` / `search_reminders` it means no filter. On `list_reminders` the check applies even when `filter` is supplied (which then takes priority over the value). `observed` echoes the saved object as read right after save (`id`, `title`, `is_completed`, `has_recurrence`, `due`) regardless of `next_occurrence.status`.

| Next status | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `confirmed` | The same ID/list/source was observed as incomplete with unchanged known recurrence rules and a strictly later comparable due date. `reminder` contains the observed item, including `id` and `due`, and `message` reads `Next occurrence: <date> [<time> [<zone>]]` in the reminder's own wall clock, never a UTC instant. |
| `unknown` | The ID changed/disappeared, rules/due cannot be compared, or the record has not advanced. `reminder` is null and `reason` explains why. |
| `not_applicable` | Non-recurring item, reopening, or an already-completed target. `reminder` is null. |

The resolver observes the saved object exactly once, synchronously, before the handler suspends: EventKit advances a recurring reminder in place during `save`, so that read already reflects the successor. It does not poll, force cloud sync, call `reset`, or use title/external-ID guesses — a later read of the cached store could only reflect what another writer did, so it would misattribute a concurrent edit as this call's successor. The observation is local to this process's cached store; an edit made concurrently by Reminders.app or another device is not visible to it. It deliberately does not emit `none`: absence alone cannot prove a recurring series ended. Different-ID successors and sources without reliable observable identity remain `unknown`. A confirmed result is a best-effort local observation, not a cross-device transactional guarantee. A next occurrence can still be overdue.

**An unknown next occurrence is not a failed completion. Do not repeat the write.** Only save failures use the MCP error path. Existing ID-only writes do not guarantee exactly-once behavior on client/transport retries; an ID may already refer to a later occurrence.

Undo/redo of a recurring completion is identity-guarded: the record keeps the pre-write due/rules/list/source snapshot, and the operation runs only if the identifier still resolves to that same occurrence (completion state and title are not identity). Once the identifier no longer resolves to the recorded occurrence — the series advanced (on iCloud the finished occurrence is kept as a separate completed record), or the item's due / rules / list / source were edited since — the undo fails with an explicit message and the history entry is **discarded**, so every earlier operation stays undoable; act on the intended occurrence explicitly instead. Transient failures (store errors, a reminder that cannot be found right now) keep the entry for a retry (#191), which also means an entry for a deleted item stays until cleared, as with every other undo arm. A recurring snapshot with no due or no rules is recorded with the legacy identifier-keyed entry instead — for that subset the pre-#204 behaviour (a no-op undo after a rollover, a redo that completes the successor) remains. The guard applies the read paths' refresh (`refreshSourcesIfNecessary()` when a mutation marked the store stale) before comparing. A redo never re-snapshots: after a redo that rolled the series over, the next undo fails and is discarded. On-device (iCloud, 2026-09-07): after a confirmed rollover the undo refused with the message above and the older entry became undoable; with no rollover (`occurrence_count: 1`) undo and redo both succeeded. Non-recurring undo is unchanged; `undo_history` lists guarded entries as `Completed recurring reminder: <title>` / `Reopened recurring reminder: <title>`.

The MCP response remains JSON in text content; this change does not migrate to MCP `structuredContent`. Clients rejecting unknown fields must update their decoders. Clients that read only the old `is_completed` field must migrate to `operation` to distinguish successful completion from successor state.

## Verification

Unit tests cover recurrence/date serialization, DST and the successor decision. Injected handler/dispatch tests cover the actual JSON envelope, count semantics and reopening. macOS CI compiles and runs the suite. On-device check (2026-09-07, iCloud list, daily rule, `--cli` against a Developer-ID-signed build): completing the reminder advanced the **same** identifier in place to the next day and left it incomplete (`is_completed: false` with `operation.status: succeeded`), the synchronous observation returned `next_occurrence.status: confirmed` with the advanced due, and iCloud spawned a **separate** completed record under a new identifier for the finished occurrence. Local and Exchange lists have not been checked. Verify the running binary version before those checks; use the same MCP session for undo/redo.
